## Project Description <a name="description"></a>

### Business Understanding

Airbnb, founded as part of the sharing economy, enables everyone to rent out accommodations for short term. After itâ€™s expansion in the last decade, the company faces criticism as rising Airbnb rentals extract living spaces and leads to higher rents for locals.

The analysis should show if Airbnb is a serious competitor to the hospitality industry, who offers accommodations and how cities are impacted from this development.

### Data Understanding

This analysis project uses data from insidedairbnb. Key objects are Airbnb listings and their reviews, which are provided in separated files. Airbnb states that about 50% of guests leave a review, which makes them a good proxy for the platform usage in a city. The listing file consists of one row per listing and contains an ID, listings and hosts name as several aggregated values. The review file contains the listings ID and a date for every review.

### Data Preparation and Modeling

To analyze tweets, the text is cleaned from punctuation and stopwords, stemmed and tokenized.

### Result Evaluation

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
